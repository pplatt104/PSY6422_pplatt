# psy6422_storygraph

This project visualises what ratings I give the moods of books, as listed on Storygraph. This is an app that tracks personal reading habits. The data was exported from my account, and an excel file to access it can be found here: https://1drv.ms/x/c/3b20d85ce956c1dc/EV2YbxU1guZLhSymV-haQ-wBfg4Dep8vGYkl5OcZTpaY8A?e=3MO8ZG 

This r script can be used to visualise my data to understand more about how much I tend to enjoy books that have certain moods, or can be used to look at your own storygraph data if exported from your account. To carry out this project you must have pplatt_storygraph.csv downloaded.
