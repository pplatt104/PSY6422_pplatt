## Loading my data

This data has now been loaded and cleaned of N/As. For this you will need packages tidyverse and dplyr.

Empty cells are labelled N/A when called into R.

Entries with multiple moods are then duplicated so one cell with multiple moods is transformed into multiple cells with one mood.

Two empty rows are removed.

All data from before 2024 (entries with no mood listed) are removed.

```{r}
library(here)

# Calling my data, and calling any empty cells N/A
sg_initial <- read.csv("pplatt_storygraph.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"))

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# Changing cells with multiple moods into multiple rows with one mood
new_sg <- sg_initial %>%
  separate_rows(Moods, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(Moods = trimws(Moods))

# Removing the two rows of X that simply have NAs
sg_noXrow<-select(new_sg, -X, -X.1) 

# Removing rows that have NA in the Moods column, aka all books read before 2024
sg_clear <- sg_noXrow %>% na.omit()
```
